# Human Resources Database Design

Project Steps:

The project is broken down into three major steps, with a fourth optional step. Each step informs the step that follows. The project has been designed to mimic the flow of a real-world database design project.

Step 1: This step is all about information gathering and putting it down on paper. In this step, you will be expected to complete both business and technical proposal documents required to begin the database design process.

Step 2: Step 2 is where you will walk through the design process. You will be using Lucidchart to create database diagrams that will be used to build an actual database.

Step 3: In step 3, it is time to start coding. You will use SQL DDL commands to create a database. You will then populate your database with the HR dataset. From there, you will demonstrate the effectiveness of your database by completing some SQL CRUD exercises.

Step 4: This last step is optional but gives you some ideas on how to make your completed project stand out from the rest - adding items like views, stored procedures, and security.
